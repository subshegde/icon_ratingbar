**Overview**: 
  - The `IconRatingBar` is a customizable Flutter widget that allows users to select a rating by tapping on icons, such as stars. It provides a flexible and highly customizable way of implementing a rating system, which can be visually enhanced by altering colors, icon types, and the appearance of the container holding the rating icons.

- This widget supports both solid colors and gradients for the selected state, provides customizable spacing, container styling, and various design configurations. It makes it easy for developers to integrate a rating system into their apps, whether itâ€™s for user feedback, product ratings, or any other scenario requiring a visual representation of user ratings.

**Key Features :**

*Customizable Icon Selection :*
-  Allows the selection of different icons for the selected and unselected states, using IconData (e.g., stars, hearts, etc.).
- Supports both solid colors and gradient effects for the selected icons.

*Customizable Appearance :*
- Customize the appearance of the rating container, including background color/gradient, shadow color, border color, border width, and border radius.
- The widget allows setting custom dimensions for the containerâ€™s width, height, and icon size.

*Gap Customization :*
- Adjustable gap between icons to provide flexibility for design and layout.

*Responsive Rating Updates :*
- The rating is updated dynamically when an icon is tapped, and the parent widget is notified through the `onRatingChanged` callback.

*Initial Rating :*
- Set an initial rating value, which can be used for pre-selected ratings, such as showing a previous rating or defaulting to 0.

*Customizable Color Scheme :*
- Easily configure the selected and unselected colors (or gradients) for the icons. Unselected icons can be displayed in a default color like grey, while selected icons can be highlighted with a color or gradient like yellow.

*Container Styling :*
- The widget allows you to customize the background of the container that holds the icons (with solid color or gradient), making it blend well with the overall app design.

*Shadow and Border Support :*
- The container of the rating bar can have a shadow and border styling, helping to elevate its appearance visually on the screen.
